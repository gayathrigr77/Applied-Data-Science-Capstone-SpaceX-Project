# Applied Data Science Capstone SpaceX Project

OVERVIEW : 

This capstone project is the requirement of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 
It focuses on analyzing SpaceX launch data to extract business insights and build predictive models to determine the success of rocket launches.

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This project includes:

1. Data collection using SpaceX API and web scraping
2. Data wrangling 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and SQL
4. Interactive geospatial visualization with Folium
5. Interactive dashboard development using Plotly Dash
6. Machine learning classification models to predict launch outcomes
